					<li>Go in the email invitation received that should have been received before and click the link that will take you to a page that says "Youth Team Member Registration" or something similar. (Or click that same link below)<br>
					<a href="https://my.usfirst.org/stims/Login.aspx" target="_blank" class="btn btn btn-outline">Registration Link from Invitation Email</a></li><br>
					<li>Click the button on the right side near the bottom that says "New Parent/Guardian User" and enter your information, and then click submit</li><br>

					<li>Enter a secure password, submit it, and log in on the next screen</li><br>
					<li>On the next screen in the dashboard-type area find and click the button that says "Add youth" in the middle of the second row from the top</li><br>
					<li>Fill in your child's information in the boxes marked with a red dot (to indicate that they are required fields). The field with the child's email address must be completed. The "Youth Program Participation" section is to be completed as follows:</li><br>
					<li>"2015-16 TBD (FRC)" box must be checked in the bottom right section of the area with 4 different colored boxes. (The section is labeled "FIRST Robotics Competition".)</li><br>
					<li>If your child has participated in other FIRST programs check the appropriate boxes, if not, proceed to the next step</li><br>
					<li>In all of the boxes for programs other than the FIRST Robotics Competition (such as the FIRST Lego League) check "did not participate"</li><br>
					<li>Submit</li><br>
					<li>After submitting the child information section, you should be returned to the dashboard; when there hit "Edit/View" under the child for the section about the school (there may be a glowing box around the button)</li><br>
					<li>Huntington High School is under the public/private school category and can be best found with the zip code 11743, and then after finding and choosing Huntington High School, fill in the remaining information and submit the page</li><br>
					<li>After submitting you should be returned to the dashboard page once again where the next button to hit is labeled "Apply to FRC Team" in the bottom row all of the way to the right</li><br>
					<li>Upon hitting this button you are brought to another form page where the most important piece of information is the team number, which is 5016. If all went well the team nickname should be shown as "Huntington Robotics" and located in "Huntington, NY, USA." If this information is not showing up make sure that you are using the correct team number. Then hit the "Apply to Team" button</li><br>
					<li>Finally, you must complete the online consent form which involves hitting the button labeled "Edit/View" under Consent Form Status and hitting the "Sign Form" button at the bottom of the page followed by a pop-up box that you must click through</li><br>
					<li>Once all of the above steps have been completed, your child will have an "application" submitted to join the team. After that point you have completed all of the necessary steps and all that remains is for the advisor, Mr. Brian Reynolds, or team captain Jacob Strieb to "approve" the application</li><br>
